You touch the fabric of the chair, and memories of being with your family flood back to you. You sit down. The smoky smell reminds you of your grandfather, and the way he always smiled at you when you walked by. You lean back and close your eyes to take in a deep breath. Your grandfather passed when you were fifteen. It'll be your turn soon. [line break] You open your eyes and turn towards your room, wanting to look around.
[looking around]
You wanted this room earlier. It reminds you of the emptiness of life. Well, and your impending death.[line break]You just want to wait here. 
 [z]
[italic type]Breathe,[roman type] you tell yourself. In the silence, the clock ticks.

[enables clock] [doesn’t go as fast if we don’t look at it.]
[x clock]
Your mother taught you how to read an analog clock; how 20th century she was. Do you remember how to read an analog clock?
[if player consents, mother is only disappointing]
She was a good teacher, despite not being a good mother. 
[line break]You take a deep breath. Still, you miss her. Her laughter was contagious. Her love, although conditional, was abundant. She wouldn’t want to see you like this.
[line break]You miss her.
The clock reads [the time of day in words].
[otherwise, mother is maddening]
The memory of your mother makes your blood boil; she was never there for you. She was a terrible teacher, and an even worse mother. She stopped making dinner for the family when you were 6. She stopped picking you up from school when you were 9. She forgot your 13th birthday, and every birthday after that.
[line break][italic type]Breathe.[roman type][line break]
Her birth date is July 29th, 2003. 
[line break][italic type]Breathe.[roman type][line break]
She’s a Leo. Your grandfather was also a Leo. You miss him.
[line break][italic type]Breathe.[roman type][line break]
The clock reads [the time of day]. 

You have [Time of death – the time of day] left.

[X clock]
It’s been x minutes since you last checked. You have [time of death – the time of day] left.

[X clock]
It’s been x minutes since you last checked. You have [time of death – the time of day] left. 
(I want the player to constantly remind themselves of their mortality and makes the flashback make more sense.)

Ah, time. For thousands of years, humankind worried about their limited lifespan. But no more. In the last century, the advancements in medicine have allowed wealthy people to streamline the ability to live forever. The layman’s explanation? The cells are told to stop aging, and failed organs are replaced with artificial ones. 

And it was a simple decision, really.
You can remember the exact layout of your desk. You turn around and see it just the way it was that day, in the corner of the room.

[look]
There’s a desk in the room (among all the previous things)

(on the desk, there’s a laptop at the webpage to subscribe, as well as an opened, unsealed letter from your wife.)

[x letter]
Wet blotches sporadically covered the piece of paper, making some of your wife’s cursive handwriting difficult to read. 

[read letter]
\“Babe, I love you.\”
[Continue reading? y/n] [loop]  
The words \”I’m sorry.\” was scribbled out, but you can still see it underneath the ink marks. \”Thank you. For everything. For all the loving moments.\”
I’m sorry that I must leave you early. I’m sorry I must leave our child motherless early.
[if lovedMom] But I know he will grow up to be amazing regardless; you certainly did.
[otherwise] I can only hope I was a better mother to him, than your mother was to you.

I want to give him
