    <result xml:space="preserve">Ah, time. For thousands of years, humankind worried about their limited lifespan. But no more. In the last century, the advancements in medicine have allowed wealthy people to streamline the ability to live forever. The layman's explanation? The cells are told to stop aging, and failed organs are replaced with artificial ones.&#x000A; &#x000A;And it was a simple decision, really. &#x000A;You can remember the exact layout of your desk, years ago, when you made the decision. You turn around and see it just the way it was that day, in the corner of the room.&#x000A;Well, time sure flies. The clock reads eight o'clock.&#x000A;What do you do this moment? 66&gt;</result>
